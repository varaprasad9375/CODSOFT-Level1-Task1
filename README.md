The main goal of this project is to develop a high-quality landing page. This page will be the key entry point for users, so it needs to be engaging, informative, and designed to convert visitors into customers or leads.

Design: Creating a visual layout and user interface (UI) that is modern, clean, and aligns with the brand identity of "Second."
Development: Building the landing page using appropriate web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to ensure it is responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Content Integration: Placing all necessary text, images, and other media onto the page.
Testing and Quality Assurance (QA): Thoroughly testing the page to ensure it functions correctly, loads quickly, and is free of bugs or errors.
